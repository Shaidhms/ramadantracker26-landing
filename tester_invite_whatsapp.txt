🌙 *Assalamu Alaikum!*

Ramadan Mubarak! 🤲

I've built a Ramadan companion app called *RamadanTracker26* to help us make the most of this blessed month.

📱 *What the app does:*
✅ Track all 30 days of fasting
✅ Log 5 daily prayers with reminders
✅ Quran reading planner & page tracker
✅ Tafsir & Hifz tracker
✅ Zakah calculator
✅ Live Makkah & Madinah streams
✅ Family multi-user support
✅ Good deed of the day & essential duas
✅ Stats dashboard to see your progress

🎯 *I need YOUR help!*

To publish this app on Google Play Store, I need at least *20 testers* who can keep the app installed for *14 continuous days* during Ramadan.

⚠️ *Important:*
• The 14 days must be *continuous* — if anyone uninstalls before 14 days, the count resets for everyone
• Just *use the app daily* to track your Ramadan ibadah — it's built for exactly that!
• It's *FREE*, *no ads*, and *no account needed*
• All your data stays on your device only

🤝 *How to support:*

If you're interested in helping (and using a great Ramadan tracker!), please:

1️⃣ Fill this short form with your *Gmail ID* (the one you use on Play Store):
👉 https://forms.gle/YOUR_FORM_LINK_HERE

2️⃣ I'll send you a download link once I add you as a tester

That's it! You'll be helping bring a useful Ramadan app to the entire Ummah on Play Store, In Sha Allah. 🌟

JazakAllahu Khairan! 🤲
May Allah accept all our efforts this Ramadan.
