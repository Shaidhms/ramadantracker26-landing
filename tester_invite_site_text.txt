Be a Part of Something Beautiful This Ramadan


Assalamu Alaikum! Ramadan Mubarak! 🌙

I've built a Ramadan companion app to help us make the most of this blessed month — and I need your support to bring it to the Google Play Store.


WHAT THE APP DOES

🕌 5 Daily Prayer Tracker with Smart Reminders
📖 Quran Reading Planner & Page Tracker
📜 Tafsir & Hifz Tracker
🔔 Prayer Time Notifications with Islamic Quotes
🧮 Zakah Calculator
📊 Stats Dashboard
🎥 Live Makkah & Madinah Streams
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Multi-User Support
🤲 Essential Duas & Dhikr Counter
💚 Good Deed of the Day
⭐ Laylat al-Qadr Guide
💬 30 WhatsApp Ramadan Posts
🍽️ Iftar & Sehri Tips


🎯 I NEED YOUR HELP!

To publish this app on Google Play Store, Google requires at least 20 testers who use the app for 14 continuous days.

Ramadan is the perfect time — it's exactly 30 days! Just install the app, use it daily to track your ibadah, and you'll be helping bring this app to the entire Ummah on Play Store, In Sha Allah.


⚠️ IMPORTANT — PLEASE READ

• The 14 days must be continuous — if anyone uninstalls before that, the count resets
• Just use the app daily to track your Ramadan ibadah — it's built for exactly that!
• It's completely FREE, no ads, and no account needed
• All data stays on your device — nothing is sent anywhere


🤝 HOW TO SUPPORT
